This repository contains code and additional results for the manuscript "Validating citizen science natural history observations as a tool for assessing the status and trends of marine species" where we compare population time-series from REEF citizen science data to the Reef Visual Census (https://github.com/jeremiaheb/rvc) monitoring program for 100 distinct species in Key Largo and Key West.
